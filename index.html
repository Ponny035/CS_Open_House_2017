                    <p class="lead font-kanit">KMUTT NIGHT is a kinect game with  a 3D game with a Thai horror
                        theme using the SIT building for the setting of the map. The story which
                        take place in the faculty,  Players can do missions and walkthrough the
                        building to find the way out. So this game used Kinect technology.
                        Kinect will let players control the game with your body gestures. This
                        means that players have to move their body in order to play the game.
                        With this kind of control, we expect to gain more attention from both
                        players and from people passing by. Furthermore, with Kinect, players
                        have to move their body, which is also one way to exercise.</p>

                    <p class="lead font-kanit">People who go shopping without any shopping list usually forget to buy some items that they need to buy 
                        and sometimes they do not even know what items they should buy. In addition, they might not get the cheapest price 
                        offer from the stores they decide to go. Smart Shopping project is an android application that helps you to manage 
                        your household inventory, suggests you smart shopping decisions to get good price product around your area and 
                        summarize your shopping history to help you manage your budget easily. In this project, we use optical character 
                        recognition(OCR) and the Levenshtein Distance algorithm to read a shopping receipt and add those items into your
                         inventory. To create a shopping list, there are two options which are optimizing price using Set Covering and
                          Greedy algorithms and optimizing trip. We expect users to manage their household inventories and make a better 
                          shopping decision with ease.</p>

                    <p class="lead font-kanit">Refrigerated Truck Temperature and Humidity Warning System is a
                            system that detects the temperature and humidity in the refrigerated compartment
                            of trucks. Nowadays, there are a lot of products that are delivered by refrigerated
                            trucks and they need to keep products at a suitable temperature.For example,
                            these are vegetables, fruits, and other fresh products. Because the weather in
                            Thailand is generally hot, to prevent product damage, we need to keep the
                            temperature low in the refrigerated area of food transport until delivery is
                            completed. In the refrigerated area, the temperature and humidity will differ
                            during transport. To be able to prevent product damage, the sensors can alert the
                            driver and can alert the staff at the office, who are responsible for the product. We
                            provide real time monitoring of temperature and humidity by a web-based
                            application and mobile application. We also provide real time location of trucks,
                            and history of transportation on a web-based application.</p>

                          <p class="lead font-kanit">The royal project in Chiang Mai has a vehicle rental service that uses in many aspects, such as 
                              deliver merchandise, transfer staff, etc. Each time that the royal project uses the vehicle rental service, 
                              the staffs need to pay the service charge. However, in reality, they don’t know exactly how much to pay for 
                              each trip. They just use their own feelings to estimate the cost according to the distance, road condition, 
                              and the steepness that the vehicle goes. As we can see, this kind of prediction leads to a net loss in the 
                              organization. In order to solve this problem, we created a system to calculate the approximate cost of the 
                              intra-organization vehicle rental service. Our system collects different telemetry data parameters to identify 
                              the service charge of the vehicle. The staff can access the previous driving session of each vehicle to know
                               the pattern of the cost. Furthermore, they can view the data as time-series that they can choose the interval 
                               of time.</p>

                                                Most of the blind have less opportunities to learn new things because they cannot see. So, it is hard for them to read books 
                                                unlike other people, and it is harder for them to learn unlike people who can see. Although there are some applications for
                                                 smartphones that can help the blind access books, not all blind people have smartphones. For these reasons, we want to help 
                                                 blind people by creating a website that helps them access many kinds of books. “Blindary” is going to help blind people access 
                                                 audiobooks and short stories. We have separated the project into two parts. One part is audiobook production, and the other part 
                                                 is audiobook playback. Both parts are going to be developed by separate teams. Our group will focus on the audiobook playback. 
                                                 Meanwhile, the other group will focus on audiobook production. In Blindary audiobook playback, the website was designed for 
                                                 accessibility support and use natural language processing(NLP) that can help the blind use the website easily. We use the service
                                                  from wit.ai that help blind user to interact with the website.

                                                        This project has 2 outcomes. There are Java application name ‘Holotran’ that use to convert normal video to hologram video and the android application name ‘Holotube’ that use to play hologram video on device.
